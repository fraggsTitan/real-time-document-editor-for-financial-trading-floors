Control Flow:
1. In login first company creates their instance, they then recieve a secure password which they share to their employees
2. employees on signup give their details and also this company password to authorise that they are infact from that company
3. each company is also generated an admin who can see all files, the email will be like
users_col.insert_one({
    "name": name + " Admin",
    "email": f"{name.lower().replace(' ','')}_admin@example.com",
    "password_hash": password_hash,
    "company_id": company_id,
    "role": "admin"
})
eg admin login for company named mycompany:
{
  "email": "mycompany_admin@example.com",
  "password": "the_password_from_signup"
}
the admin password is same as company password


EG company: mycompany1 on creation i got password as b15a29ef
employee: Person/person@mycompany1.com/Person
